# Music API

## Description

This is a simple controller-based API that I've wanted to build to put my skills to the test.
It also has a database connection to manage the musics.

Keep in mind that this API is very simple, but I still implemented some stuff that are better suited for complex API's.
This is purposeful, since I use this API to learn and show to anyone who comes over this repository what I can do.

### TODO

- [X] Create the artist model and its needed database changes (a table, context, DTO, repository...).
- [ ] Implement some kind of authentication/authorization system
- [ ] Learn to use CancellationTokens and apply them to the project
- [ ] Apply pagination to the API
