# Music API

## Description

This is a simple controller-based API that I've wanted to build to put my skills to the test.
It also has a database connection to manage the musics.

### TODO

- [ ] Create the music artist model and its needed database changes (a table, context, repository...).
- [ ] Implement some kind of authentication/authorization system
- [ ] Learn to use CancellationTokens and apply them to the project
- [ ] Apply pagination to the API
